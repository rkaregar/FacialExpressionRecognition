A real-time facial expression recognition program using the computer's webcam.

The face detection is based on HaarCascade filter in OpenCV and the facial expression detection model is trained using the dataset in the following challenge:

To use the program, it is enough to run the file `FacialExpressionRecognition.py`, but the model can be retrained using `TrainModel.py` as well (after downloading the original dataset).
